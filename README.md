# Java-Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing algorithms in Java. Here you will find a collection of exercises and solutions that I am working on to hone my programming skills. The emphasis is on the fundamental data structures and flow control in Java, covering:

- Sequential Structures: The foundation of how code is executed, following a series of step-by-step instructions.
- Repetitive Structures: Implementations of loops such as for, while, and do-while to perform repeated operations.
- Vectors: Use of one-dimensional arrays to store and manipulate sequences of elements.
- Matrices: Working with multi-dimensional arrays to represent and manipulate data in tables, grids, etc.

Additionally, this repository will serve as a log of the challenges I have solved on the BeeCrowd platform, a platform that offers a wide range of programming problems to develop and test your skills in algorithms and logic.
